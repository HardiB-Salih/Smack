Smack is a chat application that allows users to connect and communicate with each other in real-time. It utilizes Firebase for authentication and Firestore for storing chat data, providing a seamless and secure chatting experience. The app is built using SwiftUI for the user interface and follows the MVVM architecture for data processing.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Smack on your local development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Xcode: Ensure you have Xcode installed on your macOS system.
- Swift Package Manager (SPM): Smack uses Swift Package Manager for managing dependencies. SPM is integrated into Xcode, so you don't need to install anything separately.

### Installation

1. Clone the Smack repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HardiB-Salih/Smack.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd smack
```

3. Open the Xcode project:

```bash
open Smack.xcodeproj
```

4. Xcode should automatically resolve and fetch the required packages specified in the `Package.swift` file. If it doesn't, you can manually fetch the packages by selecting **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Update to Latest Package Versions**.

### Configuration

1. Firebase Setup:
   - Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Follow the instructions to add your iOS app to the Firebase project.
   - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and add it to your Xcode project (place it in the root folder of the project).
   - Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore in the Firebase console.

2. Build and Run:
   - Select the desired simulator or a connected device in Xcode.
   - Press the "Build and Run" button (or `Cmd + R`) to build and run the Smack app on your chosen device.
